# Materialize Demos

[Materialize] is a streaming database for real-time applications.

Our demos let you try out Materialize for yourself. Each one walks you through
building a real-time application based on streaming data using standard SQL. The
demos run in isolation on your computer, using Docker to simulate a distributed
cloud architecture.

Try one out now:
